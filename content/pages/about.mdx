## About me
I'm Malik. I was born in Lisbon and moved to Berlin where I study and work in product enablement (what the industry calls Product Manager). In my free time, you can find me reading books, programming, taking one-hour-long walks, singing and recording music, and learning something new.

My family had to build a life from scratch and worked hard to give me the kind of life they never had. I'll be forever grateful and indebted to the universe. For that reason, working on initiatives that promote more access to opportunities for people who don't have them is what gives my life meaning. My mission is to contribute to a world where more people can have the freedom to decide who they want to be.

At the moment, I'm learning formal logic, going through Goethe's body of work and on the lookout for a new professional challenge.

## About the name
I get so much joy out of hosting dinners and bringing people together. And yet, I often prefer spending the time as an observer from a safe corner of the kitchen. "Moonwith" represents this antithetical aspect of my personality.

Naming this website after myself would not accurately reflect my intention to build something collaborative. Or as I like to call it: multiplayer mode.
