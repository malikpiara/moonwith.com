<div className='scale-[1.15] mb-16'>![Image of me](/malik_bw.jpg)</div>

I'm Malik. I was born in Lisboa and moved to Berlin where I studied product management, software engineering and interaction design at [CODE](https://code.berlin/en/) and [Hasso Plattner Institute/d-school](https://hpi.de/en/d-school/).

I work in product enablement (what the industry calls Product Management). In my free time, you can find me reading books, tinkering with code and design, singing and learning something new.

My family had to build a life from scratch and work hard to give me the kind of life they never had. I'll be forever grateful and indebted to the universe. For that reason, working on initiatives that promote more access to opportunities for people who don't have them is what gives my life meaning. My mission is to contribute to a world where more people can have the freedom to decide who they want to be.

## What I'm doing right now

I'm taking time off to figure out my next step. In the meantime, I'm deepening my knowledge of databases and of computer science.

## About this site

This is my diary where I think things through “out loud”. I write Moonwith for myself and I hope everyone can benefit from it as much as I do.

Moonwith is built and designed by me. Powered by Next.js, Tailwind, Vercel and Cloudflare.

## Where does the name 'moonwith' come from?

I get so much joy out of hosting dinners and bringing people together. And yet, I often prefer spending the time as an observer, from a corner of the kitchen. "Moonwith" represents this antithetical aspect of my personality.

Naming this website after myself would not accurately reflect my intention to build something in multiplayer mode.
