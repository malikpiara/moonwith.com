I'm Malik. I was born in Lisbon and moved to Berlin where I work in product enablement (what the industry calls Product Manager). In my free time, you can find me reading books, tinkering with code and design, strolling through town, singing and recording music, and learning something new.

My family had to build a life from scratch and work hard to give me the kind of life they never had. I'll be forever grateful and indebted to the universe. For that reason, working on initiatives that promote more access to opportunities for people who don't have them is what gives my life meaning. My mission is to contribute to a world where more people can have the freedom to decide who they want to be.

## What I'm doing right now
I'm graduating [CODE University](https://code.berlin/en/) with a major in product management, and minors in interaction design and software engineering. Looking for a full time position as product manager. In the meantime I'm:

1. Relearning formal logic, which I consider one of the foundational disciplines of decision making.

2. Building a [text editor](/dashboard) that makes you write in a bold and clear way. It highlights your text and gives you advice. This is a way of brushing up on my technical skills and increasing my writing frequency.

If you're looking for someone to help improve your product and bring energy to your team, I'll be available from January onwards. Happy to relocate anywhere.

## About this website
This is my diary where I think things through “out loud”. I write Moonwith for myself and I hope everyone can benefit from it as much as I do.

Hex is the sixth version of Moonwith. Built and designed by me. Powered by Next.js, Vercel and Cloudflare.

[You can check the previous version here](https://moonwith.com/).

## Where does the name 'moonwith' come from?
I get so much joy out of hosting dinners and bringing people together. And yet, I often prefer spending the time as an observer, from a corner of the kitchen. "Moonwith" represents this antithetical aspect of my personality.

Naming this website after myself would not accurately reflect my intention to build something in multiplayer mode.
