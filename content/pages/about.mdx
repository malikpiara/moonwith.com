## About the name
I get so much joy out of hosting dinners and bringing people together. And yet, I often prefer spending the time as an observer from a safe corner of the kitchen. "Moonwith" represents this antithetical aspect of my personality.

Naming this website after myself would not accurately reflect my intention to build something collaborative. Or as I like to call it: multiplayer mode.
