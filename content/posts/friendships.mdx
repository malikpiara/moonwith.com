Sometimes we hold on to relationships that are no longer working. We hold on to that friend who was there for our sweet sixteen. We hold on to that group we formed in college, when we were still trying to please everyone because we desperately wanted to belong somewhere. We hold on to people who have been part of our lives for as long as we can remember. Even when the only things connecting us are memory and a quiet sense of obligation.

Relationships change because we change. What we want today is likely different from what we wanted yesterday. And because we have different goals, we take different paths. And come to embody different values.

We must come to terms with the fact that letting some people go might be an important part of growing. Spending time with old friends might not be fun anymore. It may sap our energy more than invigorate us. And thatâ€™s okay.

Having the courage to let go of relationships that are not sustain us might be what we need to create space for more meaningful connection.
