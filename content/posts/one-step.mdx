Anyone can sprint for hundred meters but running a marathon takes patience. Pacing. Discipline. It's easy to celebrate the success of athletes, artists, scientists and entrepreneurs, and to label them genius. But if you pay closer attention and develop enough curiosity, you'll see that the most prolific ones often show up every day and do their work in silence.

And it's not too late for you. That is an excuse that is easy to make but that falls flat when you realise Van Gogh decided to become an artist when he was twenty-seven years old.

The kind of impact and personal transformation you dream about is within reach. It likely won't come tomorrow. But taking one step every day is enough. One dot every day becomes a line. And that soon becomes one block.

What step can you take every day?
