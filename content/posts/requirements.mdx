The idea that someone should have to meet requirements like a certain age or height, or belong to a given circle to become a suitable partner may not be serving us.

We may be hurting our chances of finding deep connection because we haven't given enough thought to what might, in fact, make us happy.

The connection and intimacy we long for may be out there for us to grab, if we decide to open ourselves to other worlds. If we decide to widen our criteria. If we decide that what other people think of us can't be more important than our own happiness.
