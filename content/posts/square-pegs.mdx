Good, creative, outstanding work is born in places where people can be themselves.

Just because there is a norm or a standard for how people are supposed to work, it doesn't mean we should follow it. Norms change. And if we want to get the best out of the people, it may be time to embrace them as they are. To make new moulds for the square and hexagonal pegs. To create room for the dysmorphias we all inherently share.

When the only tool we have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. When the only mould we have is squared, every other shape feels out of place. What we perceive as weak or undesirable traits, may as well, under certain circumstances, be strength and sagacity in disguise.
