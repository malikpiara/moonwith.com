On a given afternoon, after a sip of coffee and the occasional stroll through town, we may find ourselves finally letting go of our need to be important.

We may realise that being in the spotlight or recognised for the work we do is not as important or fulfilling as we once thought it would be.

We may come to find the understated appeal of going to bed before ten, and of living a calm and tranquil life in a place few people heard about charming.
