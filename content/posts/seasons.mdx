Just because the leaves are falling, it doesn't mean they won't grow again. Seasons come and go.

If you're going through winter, find solace in the knowledge that spring is waiting patiently around the corner. If you're going through summer, know that the warm and tender embrace by the sun won't last forever.

The moment we start to wither is the moment we start to grow. The moment we start to grow is the moment we start to wither.
