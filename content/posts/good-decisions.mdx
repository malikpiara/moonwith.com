If everything we do is a decision, our ability to make decisions that lead to good outcomes is the most important aspect of our lives. From the way we spend our time, to the people we choose to surround ourselves with, to the habits we decide to cultivate and the bets we make when we're building a product or managing a company.

Eating, sleeping, and exercising cannot be afterthoughts because by neglecting them, we impair our ability to think clearly and to make decisions that are rational and based on strategy.

This idea of self-care is easy to understand in theory, but actually hard to internalise. When we make a bad decision, we believe we're making a good one. Our sense of self-perception is flawed. And that's where the problem lies. We don't compute the difference that a practice of meditation or a proper night of sleep can have on our decision making process.

No amount of mental models, theoretical knowledge and experience can replace the sometimes less visible gains we get from the basics. They're basics for a reason.
