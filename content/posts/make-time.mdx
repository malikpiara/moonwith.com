As we go through life, we find ourselves in different places. Navigating different chapters. Weeks, months, years go by. Work gets in the way. We get busy. Without being aware, relationships that used to mean everything fade away.

I used to tell myself a different story. While recognising friendships would assume different shapes, I believed some would last forever because of the shared history and closeness. But friendships have to be earned. If we really care about them, we have to put in the work. We need to make them a priority.

A helpful piece of advice would be to schedule time to be with the people you care about. Perhaps recurrently. This may feel like a jarring suggestion. It's unnatural. But setting time in advance ensures we get to spend quality time with the people who are important, despite the constant pressures and struggles of everyday life.
