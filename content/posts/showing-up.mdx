Building up a new skill or working towards a new goal can be frustrating. Especially when we're getting started. Our output is often below a level we're satisfied with.

A proven way to get better at anything is by showing up consistently. To put in the work on both sunny and rainy days. To show up, even when we're not good enough.

The trajectory is more important than our skill. It doesn't matter how good we are. What matters is how good we aim to become. And how much we're willing to improve by deliberately deciding to show up.

With every little step, we grow bolder. We grow our confidence. Without noticing, we slowly start developing mastery and reaching levels that were beyond our imagination.
