No one is born an expert. Shakespeare had to learn the abc. Einstein had to memorise multiplication tables. 

Competency takes time but it's within reach. With sufficient time and encouragement, almost anyone can become a good singer, develop fluency in mandarin, run a marathon or start a company.

How good you are today doesn't matter. What matters is the degree to which you believe you can improve.
