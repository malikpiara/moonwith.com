I've made mistakes, burned bridges, tainted my reputation with people that I cared about. And I've done so countless times, throughout my adult life.

If history is any indication of future actions, I'll do it again soon. If you're anything like me, you'll probably do it too.

I often hope I would have handled certain situations differently. And looking forward, the primary lesson I carry with me is that we can set out to be more charitable. To see the best intentions in everyone. To judge less and try to understand more.

To realise that people carry the same face and same name throughout years despite becoming someone else through a collection of memories, experiences and personal blunders.
