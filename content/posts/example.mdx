Everything we do carries more weight when we're part of a minority. Our actions and our character affect not only how other people see us, but also how they perceive anyone else who looks or feels like us.

Every now and then, you will come across people who embarass you, and who give the group you're a part of a bad name. You can't control how they behave, but you can help tip the scales and open doors for yourself and others by setting an example.
