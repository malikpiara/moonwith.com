Even though nothing in life is guaranteed, better results are more likely to follow if you keep showing up. Part of the reason this is true is because many of the games we play are essentialy "a numbers game". We tend to get better at them by going through more of them.

The idea of tackling a challenge with a quantitive solution feels primitive but that's because we have a tendency to romanticize the universe. 

Be patient and keep at it.
