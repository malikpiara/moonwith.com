Always assume good intentions and don't take anything personally.\n3. Set clear expectations for what you want out of a relationship. Revisit them as often as possible.\n4. Know when to give something up. The time, money and energy you invested doesn't make it more worthwhile. Keep the concept of sunk costs in mind.\n5. Don't waste time or energy in things you cannot change.\n6. Stand up for what you believe in. Be willing to walk alone if you have to.\n7. Embrace your uniqueness. No one else in the entire world thinks the way you do or has your life experience. And that's your unfair advantage.\n8. Trust yourself and your decisions.\n9. Extreme people get extreme results. Work as hard as you can.\n10. Focus on the things that don't change. The books, technologies, ideas, relationships that are likely to still be here in 50 years.\n11. Prioritise practical experience over books and theory. The shorter the feedback cycle, the better.\n12. Admit your mistakes and shortcomings openly and emphatically. That will make you grow.\n13. Be humble with knowledge. What you know is so much less than what you don't know. And every person knows more about something than you do.\n14. Surround yourself with people who challenge you and help you grow.\n15. Be consistent and practice your craft deliberately but be patient with results. It takes time but sooner or later they'll come. Keep showing up and doing the work.\n16. Reject most labels and boxes. Don't let them define who you are or who you can become.\n17. Cultivate disobedience. In yourself and others. That's how new knowledge is created and how society evolves.\n18. Seek to understand the world. Leave your bubble and travel as often as you can on your own.\n19. Don't try to be perceived as smart. That will keep you from learning and connecting with people genuinely.\n20. Question everything about yourself and about what you believe in. Don't be afraid of changing your mind or seeming inconsistent.",

    "content": "When we see our abilities as something that can't change, we're operating under a fixed mindset. When we see our abilities as something that can be nurtured and developed like a muscle, we're adopting a growth mindset.\n\nPeople that share a growth mindset are more likely to seek out challenges and persist when they hit a roadblock. Failure is not seen as a source of shame or embarrassment. Rather as an opportunity for personal and professional growth.\n\nThe ideas that underlie the growth mindset were introduced to me by Khan Academy when I was seventeen years-old. Coming to the absurd realisation that Shakespeare had to learn his abcs like the rest of us. Or that there had been a time in his life where Einstein understood maths in a shallower way than we do was eye-opening. It transformed and forever altered the course of my life.\n\nBack then, I was undertaking a vocational high school degree instead of a traditional one. I made this decision out of fear after having failed tenth grade because I believed my ability to learn maths was limited. This belief was reinforced by my environment.\n\nThe new-found realisation empowered me to take a stance. After a long and hard conversation with my dad, I decided to go back to a normal high school in the following year to study science and technology. With advanced courses in maths, physics and biology. Something that was unimaginable a couple of months before that. I went on to do so much more than I ever deemed possible. From learning how to sing, to starting a band, to building a company.\n\n9 years ago I saw the premise of the growth and fixed mindsets as diametrically opposed and mutually exclusive. Now I understand that life is often more nuanced than we make it out to be when we're young. Even though we operate predominantly under one of the two mindsets, we're prone to adopt aspects that relate to a fixed mindset. This is true when we're learning a new skill and work in an environment where our competency is lower than our peers. Or when we get fired or laid off and struggle with job safety. Understanding this complexity is important if we want to build a real, lasting growth mindset culture around us.\n\nIn the workplace, we usually work in teams where people have different levels of experience. This can affect us. And it can also affect of our peers and their motivation. One thing we can do is sharing our work and the process behind the final result more openly, with the flaws and parts we feel less proud about. Doing so is an act of courage and generosity. It helps others realise that there's nothing wrong with showing work that feels raw. It helps people who are less experienced tone down the more fixed aspects of their mindset and realise that they can improve. It helps them understand that the people they work with are also on a trajectory of growth that they can also join.",

    "content": "Real, lasting transformation can sometimes feel out of reach. And although different people may need different systems, there are powerful principles we can extract from Benjamin Franklin's system for self-improvement.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was one of the founding fathers of the United States and served as diplomat in France. In his autobiography, he outlined the program he designed to cultivate his personal character. This is a system he began working on when he was 20 years-old and I believe it contributed greatly to his success in the public sphere.\n\nTo gain more awareness of his progress, he made a list of 13 personal virtues he found desirable. Then, he created a table with a column for each day of the week. Every day, he would track his progress and add a marking to the values he failed to live by. The goal was to have an empty table without any marking.\n\n### Benjamin Franklin's 13 Virtues\n\n1. **Temperance:** Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n\n2. **Silence:** Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\n\n3. **Order:** Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n\n4. **Resolution:** Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n\n5. **Frugality:** Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; waste nothing.\n\n6. **Industry:** Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n\n7. **Sincerity:** Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and if you speak, speak accordingly.\n\n8. **Justice:** Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\n\n9. **Moderation:** Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\n\n10. **Cleanliness:** Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation.\n\n11. **Tranquility:** Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n\n12. **Chastity:** Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.\n\n13. **Humility:** Imitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\nThe virtues are ordered by their likelihood to affect the others, once they are acquired. Consolidating one habit, should make acquiring the next easier. You should focus on a single value every week and only move on to the next one once your progress is tangible.\n\nFranklin's system is an example of personal discipline and tenacity. It invites a practice of daily mindfulness and reflection, which becomes easier and compounds over time. Although I don't follow it religiously, I still believe outlining the virtues we value the most can be a powerful way of increasing our awareness about the kind of person we want to be.\n\n<div>\n![Screenshot from Notion](/franklin-method.png)\n</div>",

When I finally mustered the courage to attend one, I showed up in the most formal and uncomfortable attire I could find. Back then I still thought impression was more important than essence. People who are great at what they do, don’t need to signal they are smart or competent by wearing preppy clothes or throwing around their titles.\n\nThat’s when I met [David Dias](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/daviddias.me/). David is working to make the web work offline and in a distributed way. As well as faster and more secure (check [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)). Meeting him was a pivotal moment in my life, as he taught me the value of action, ownership and pragmatism over fancy words, titles and good intentions.\n\nEvery time I came to him with my reluctance to join an event, start a new project or speak with someone he would tell me **“one is greater than zero”**. What he was trying to say is that **we gain considerably more by doing something than by not doing it, when there is no better alternative**. This holds especially true if you're in highschool or college. My alternatives were staying home pretending to study for an exam I didn't care about or playing video games.\n\nI carried on with David’s words on my mind. Going to events, inviting people I admire for coffee, emailing conference organisers to let me join as a volunteer. This path led me to build Upframe and the Startup Playground, a place where young makers could go to learn more about how to build products and start companies with mentors like David.\n\nUpframe brought me some attention. And I know it was mainly luck, not merit or knowledge that got me there. What took time and introspection to understand was that I inadvertently created part of that luck. By putting myself in situations that increased my chances of attaining good outcomes.\n\nImagine two boxes made out of cardboard. One with a single marble. The second has a handful of them. If we were to shake both boxes, the latter would produce more collisions. Make more noise — In the real world, collisions generate opportunities. — Some of them can lead to dramatic results, like the ones that led me to start a company or move to Berlin.\n\nSpending most of our days entangled in a work-home routine is akin to the first box. We have more to gain when we put ourselves out there. When we decide to leave our comfort zone.\n\nLooking at the future we cannot tell when life changing events will take place. A couple of years ago, I would not believe anyone if they told me I would be living in Berlin. Having that in mind, **we can put ourselves in situations that enable serendipity to take place**. Join communities. Read books. Let people know what you’re working on. Talk to strangers. Go to parties where you don't know most people. Send a letter to someone you admire. Install a dating app. Move to a city that has more things going on. Create your own luck.\n\n### Ways to create your own luck\n\n1. Join a meetup group in your city.\n2. Host a dinner where every guest has to bring a plus one.\n3. Go to a hackathon. With friends. Or alone.\n4. Share your ideas in public. On social media. With your friends.\n5. Ask for help in public. Share your challenges.\n6. Email or tweet someone you admire.\n7. Go to dinner parties. From friends. From acquaintances. From people who share your values and goals.\n8. Grab coffee or lunch with someone new every week.\n9. Join a community.\n10. Create your own community.\n11. Take classes on subjects unrelated with your major.\n12. Sit in a random college class.\n13. Work or study from different places. Cafés. Coworking places. Public libraries.\n14. Create and keep a Twitter/X/Threads/BlueSky/Mastodon account.\n15. Keep your direct/private messages open on social media.\n16. Add a location to your Instagram posts so more people can find you.\n17. Take public transports more often.\n18. Use stickers of technologies you like to use on your laptop.\n19. Take the most crowded path to work.\n20. Move to a city that has more things going on in your industry.\n21. Use a dating app every now and then.\n22. Install the [Breakfast App](https://thebreakfast.app/).\n23. Write and publish a blog post every day.",

Working hard and [showing up every day](https://moonwith.com/posts/train) probably matters more than any other thing. Sometimes, it can be discouraging to not see results right away but we have to trust the process.\n\n### Rasmus Andersson\nEvery person is different and we all have a unique perspective, so it's hard to give general advice, but anyhow:\n\nDo! Make! Do a lot of work, do A LOT of work. The saying that in order to be great at something, you have to do it 10 000 times is true (in most cases.) \n\nYou can read all the books in the world about playing soccer but the only way you can be a great soccer player is (obviously) by playing a lot of soccer (and maybe reading a few books.) The same is true for any path to mastery — you have to practice, a lot.\n\nNow, about software design vs engineering. Think about software the way you'd think about furniture: To build a good chair you need to consider everything from reason and personality to materials and maintenance.\n\nThere are of course people specialized in many aspects of furniture: materials, types of furniture, part of the process (ie. concepts, development, production etc.) and so on. But as a designer of a chair you can'd do a good job without considering and prototyping the whole.\n\nIt is important to find your specialization of course, otherwise you will have a hard time selling yourself (ie. what—concretely—do you bring to the table?)\n\nWhat I often see in the software industry is people putting themselves into silos (which is different from specialization.) For example someone who only does motion design but would never imagine actually implementing an animation in e.g. an iOS app (for prototyping purposes.)\n\nA furniture designer doing that would be pretty terrible at designing chairs;\n\n\"I design the most exquisite legs\" \n\nVery pretty! But they break if you put the chair on a carpet and apply lateral force, so we can't ship that.\n\nI think it’s REALLY hard to take this advice to heart in the insanely-fast paced software industry. The idea that you might have to work hard for 5-10 years to get to where you want to be might seem crazy when the software people build only lasts for a fraction of that time.",
