Now I understand that life is often more nuanced than we make it out to be when we're young. Even though we operate predominantly under one of the two mindsets, we're prone to adopt aspects that relate to a fixed mindset. This is true when we're learning a new skill and work in an environment where our competency is lower than our peers. Or when we get fired or laid off and struggle with job safety.

This can affect us. And it can also affect of our peers and their motivation. One thing we can do is sharing our work and the process behind the final result more openly, with the flaws and parts we feel less proud about. Doing so is an act of courage and generosity. It helps others realise that there's nothing wrong with showing work that feels raw. It helps people who are less experienced tone down the more fixed aspects of their mindset and realise that they can improve.
