And although there were signs, like me leaving social media behind, getting a desk to work from home for the first time since the pandemic forced me to, or tending more often to places where I can work from or eat in silence, what gave that conclusion away was an episode that happened the other day at university.

I'm internalising that our time is too short to spend time with people who drain our energy out, or to work on something that no one wants, or that anyone else could build.
