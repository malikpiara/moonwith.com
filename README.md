# Moonwith

When I was in college, I built a blog, Moonwith, to attain proficiency in web development and to become a better writer. Since then, I rebuilt this project from scratch using different approaches, frameworks and design languages. This is Moonwith Seven, built and designed by me. Powered by Next.js and Cloudflare workers.
